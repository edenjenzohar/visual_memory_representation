1. targest were selected semi randomly (targets were selected such that each target has many potential distractors
according to the required contrasts
2. distractors were selected such that mean similarity will be equal across the 3 distractor layer conditions. 

note: this is the result of previous pilots in which similarity was different across the 3 conditions: 
this resulted in a stepwise pattern in memory (as more similar distractors are harder)
